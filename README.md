As part of QA course (Afeka college) we created and ran automatics tests 
on "https://www.demoblaze.com/" website (demo website for QA automatics tests).

* The input.json and Test.java files should be located in the project's src schools.

* The output file is called: log.txt (created alone in the first run of its school development e. Change the paths of these files - park the values ​​in rows 29,30 in the Test.java file.

To run the program (read from the Json file) we used the Jackson library.
